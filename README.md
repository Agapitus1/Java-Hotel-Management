# Java-Hotel-Management

This is a Hotel Management project that lets you do things like save customer info, book different types of rooms, order food for specific rooms, cancel room bookings, and generate bills. You can also check out room features and availability. It works with a menu system and keeps running until you decide to quit. To save data, like customer info and booked rooms, the program uses file storage when you exit, so you won't lose any info if you restart later. When the program starts up again, it reads this file to know what was happening before. File writing is done in a separate part of the program to run at the same time as other tasks. If you try to book a room that's already taken, the program will give you a custom error. Plus, it's set up to handle any unexpected problems smoothly.
